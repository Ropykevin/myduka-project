What is Flask
=>Micro web framework written in Python 
=>Micro Means its lightweight  and doesn't include everything by default 
=>Used to build web applications ,Apis ,dashboards

    Steps to use Flask
1.install flask
    pip install flask 
2.Import Flask class from flask framework
    from flask import Flask
3.create an app object which is the Instance of the class Flask with argument __name__
    app=Flask(__name__)

4.create routes
    =>What is route -> path used to connect a URL with a Python Function 
    =>always starts with a /

    How to create a route 
        @app.route('/')
        def home():
            return 'Hello world'
Routes to create:
'/'
'/products'
'/sales'
'/stock'

5.run the app
    app.run()

=>Each Function on a route should return an html file
=>In Flask All HTML files must be in a folder called templates
=>In Flask ALL css,images and javascript files must be in folder called static   
=>render_template function in flask is used to render html files
=>you must import render_template from flask before using it

            Task
1.Create index,products ,sales and stock html files inside the templates folder 
2.create folder static for css and js files
3.Render each html file to its own route

NB=>always update your github repo
    commands to update 
    1.git add .
    2.git commit -m "name of the change"
    3.git push origin branch name



    Flask Day 2
=>fetch data on main.py
1.import the fetch data function to main
2.call the function to fetch data on specific routes

=>Display data on the ui using JINJA2
=>Templating engine used to write python like code on HTML

    How to use Jinja
1.Variables are written inside double curly braces {{variable}} in HTML  and the variable must be declared on render_template function in python
2.A python operation is written inside single curly brace with percent signs e.g  {% for i in sequence %} and the operation must be closed {% endfor %}

        Task
1.Display sales and stock on the page 
2.make all html files bootstrap enabled 
3.create tables on products,sales,and stock html files with random data with columns similar to the ones on the database

        Flask Day 3(display data in tables)

=>Display the fetched data on tables
=>using JINJA2
=>We start with the products data
=>we loop the products data to html table 

Display stock,sales and products in a table
update github

        Task
1.Navbar on each html  file *
2.Create a modal with a form to add products ,stock and  sales *
3.style your project
4.make homepage appealing


    Flask Day 4
=>Navigation using Navbar
=>we write the routes on the href attribute

        Posting Data (UI=>server=>Database)
=>You can send data from form on UI to the server-side flask route which then stores it in the database 

        HTTP Methods 
1.GET ->used when fetching data from a resource 
2.POST ->used when sending data to a resource(e.g submitting a form)

    Important Notes
=>Every form input Must have a name attribute ->flask uses this to access the form data
=>In main.py ,Create route that:
    1.checks HTTP method (GET or POST)
    2.Receives form data from the UI
    3.call the insert function to add data to the database

    Request,Redirect,url_for  in Flask
    1.Request
=>used to receive data from the form(ui->server)

    2.Redirect
=>Redirect redirects the user to another url after perfoming an action
    3.url_for
=>Url_for takes the function name then redirects to the route 

NB=>ON the form element we must have Action attribute with route as the value and method attribute with post as the value
